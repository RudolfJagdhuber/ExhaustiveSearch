Description: The goal of this package is to provide an easy to use, fast and
    and scalable exhaustive search framework. Exhaustive feature selections 
    typically require a very large number of models to be fitted and evaluated. 
    Execution speed and memory management are crucial factors for these tasks. 
    The package solves both issues with a multi-threaded C++ backend, which 
    keeps memory usage constant by only storing the best results.
